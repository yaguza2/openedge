    <p>
    Baritus is an open source framework for building Java web applications. 
	Baritus is a powerfull extension of Maverick that focusus on developing web 
	applications using plain old java objects.
	</p>
	<p>
		Allthough there is no shortage of good-quality OSS MVC frameworks, Baritus has the following unique points:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Ordinary JavaBeans can be populated from the http request, 
				with fine-grained automatic error reporting and the built-in support for 
				displaying the original user input when conversion or validation failed.
			</li>
			<li>
				Programmatic configuration instead of XML-based configuration (for e.g. validation and form instantiation), 
				which gives the users more flexiblity, and keeps the code easier to read.
			</li>
			<li>
				Many extension points. Though Baritus can be used out-of-the-box, it can be tailored to the taste 
				of the developers that have to work with it.
			</li>
		</ul>
		As Baritus uses (but does not in any way alter) the very mature MVC web framework Maverick, 
		users can take advantage of it's stability and flexiblity.
