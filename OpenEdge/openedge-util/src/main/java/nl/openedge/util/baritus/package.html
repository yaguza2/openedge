Generic Baritus utility classes.
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			AbstractMockControlTest. Base class for JUnit test cases that
            can be used to test Baritus controls, Validators etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			BaritusControlTest Abstract class for testing controls in a simulated
            Baritus/ Maverick/ webapp environment, so that constructs like validators,
            populators etc can be tested in isolation without much effort. This basecontrol
            keeps references to things like the formBean, formBeanContext and logical
            view and overrides some of the propected methods from Baritus with public
            methods in order to make testing easier.
