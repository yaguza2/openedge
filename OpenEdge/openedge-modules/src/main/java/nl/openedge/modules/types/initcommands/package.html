This package contains the InitCommand types and their command implementations. 
You use InitCommands to be able to decorate components. Eg, a component
that implements <code>BeanType</code> will have its properties 
populated from configuration and a component that implements
<code>DependentType</code> will have its dependencies automatically
resolved and set as properties.
