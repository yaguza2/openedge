Version 2.2.4    [10/03/2005]

- Fixed to work with latest jdom.jar

-----

Version 2.2.3    [8/8/2004]

- Every document view with a path attribute will now be a view with transforms internally,
  the first transform being the dispatch/ document transform with the given path.
  This makes it possible to have document views without a dispatch transform,
  functionality needed for the opt-freemarker package proposed by Ed Ward.

-----

Version 2.2.2    [6/27/2004]

- Use Commons Logging instead of Log4J.
- Log the stacktrace when reloadConfig() throws a Configuration exception on initialization.
- A custom controller factory can now be provided. See the manual for an example.

-----

Version 2.2.1    [virtual]

- Added support for URLs (http:, https:, file:, ftp:, jar:) as paths in
  XSL transforms. Also added support for monitoring 'file:' URLs and
  re-caching them upon change.
- Redirects now properly encode session ids in the URL (if necessary).

-----

Version 2.2.0    [6/21/2003]

- Enhanced TransformStep API to allow content-type information
  to be passed to subsequent steps.  This is an API change.
- Split up param collections; controller, view, and transform
  params are now separate.  This is an API change.
- Better error handling when dispatching to a bad path.
- Rewrote friendbook-jsp.
- Added friendbook-jsp-fbu (uses FormBeanUser).
- Allowed programmatic override of maverick config file and
  transform locations.
- Special handling of config file/transform locations which
  are full URLs (http:, https:, file:, ftp:).
- Fixed a bug preventing ControllerSingleton.init() from being
  called.
- Controller classes are now loaded using the current context
  classloader rather than Class.forName().
- Changed Dispatcher init parameters to public.
- Chaining of MaverickContext is now optional, and default is false.

-----

Version 2.1.2    [12/12/2002]

- MaverickContext is now persisted through recursive command
  invocations, so chaining commands together with document
  views is now possible.
- ModelLifetime.discard() is now guaranteed to be called, even
  if there was an exception.
- RedirectView now understands a special param '#'
- Added ThrowawayFormBeanUser
- Reduced overzealous logging level in several runtime places.
- Fixed bad page in friendbook-jsp

-----

Version 2.1.1   [6/18/2002]

- Fixed bug preventing the "trivial" view type from working.

-----

Version 2.1     [6/11/2002]

- Heterogeneous transforms are now supported.
- A Context object is now passed to Controllers, Views,
  and Transforms rather than a multitude of arguments.
- The model is now set on the context explicitly rather
  than being returned from Controller.go()
- Params are supported on controller, view, and transform
  nodes.  Params are interpreted differently (but hopefully
  in an intuitive and consistent manner) by each pluggable
  module.

-----

Version 2.0     [3/27/2002]

- Added "null" view type.
- Added ModelLifetime interface so that models can optionally
  manage internal resources.
- Improved the error message when resources cannot be
  found by XSLTransform.

-----

Version 2.0-rc   [3/6/2002]

- XSL Transforms now have three cache options:  preload,
  disabled, and lazy.
- Config options can be overriden by system properties
  which have the format:  maverick.parentnode.attribute.
- More documentation.

-----

Version 2.0-b2    [2/20/2002]

- Config file path is now configurable.
- Can now specify an XSL to transform the config.
- Eliminated all use of getRealPath().
- Paths are allowed as part of a command name.
- Throwaway controllers can have params populated from the
  config file.
- Transform interface now takes a Source instead of Node.
- View name defaults to view ref attribute.
- XSLTransform now uses SAX between stages rather than
  building DOM trees.
- Lots of documentation written.

-----

Version 2.0-b1    [1/10/2002]

This is a complete, ground-up rewrite.  Major new features:

- Pluggable view types.
- Pluggable transform types.
- View mode switching.
- The option of having Singleton controllers.
- Pluggable bean population (and validation, etc) logic.
- Log4J logging.

In addition, some view types and examples have been broken out into
optional modules which can be downloaded separately.

-----

Version 1.0.1     [11/27/2001]

- Fixed a bug preventing JSP beans from being placed in session or
  application scope.

-----

Version 1.0.0     [10/16/2001]

- Added support to disable caching/compiling of templates. (see 
  new servlet param named preloadTemplates
- Added defaultRequestCharset servlet param

Version 0.9.7     [7/12/2001]

- maverick.xml: Renamed "id" attribute to "name" in "view" and 
  "command" elements
- Fixed bug in domify/ElementAdapter.hasChildren(). This bug can be found
  when doing child/sibling xpath expressions.
- Updated friendbook-velocity to redirect to friends page after init login
- 

-----

Version 0.9.6     [6/19/2001]

- Added the ability to define parameters in the config file for
  transforms.
- Added the ability to define context parameters in the config file
  for velocity views.

  look-and-feel to all the pages.  It's much cleaner now.

-----

Version 0.9.5     [6/15/2001]

- Significant changes to the config file format; see the maverick.xml
  documentation for details.
- Velocity can now be used for view templating.
- When issuing a redirect, if the model is a java.util.Map, the values
  are used as url parameters.
- Fixed bug:  Content-type was being ignored for some views without
  transforms.
- FAQ questions regarding Velocity and Servlet params added.

-----

Version 0.9.1     [5/4/2001]

- Bean properties can now begin with "is", as per the JavaBeans spec.
- source-model no longer requires a controller; the resulting
  document node is simply empty.  The friendbook example's signup
  form now uses this pattern.

-----

Version 0.9     [5/28/2001]

- Optimized the performance of <source-document> and <source-jsp> without
