	Interceptors.
</p>
<p>
	 Interceptors provide a means to encapsulate cross-cutting code that is 
	 executed on pre-defined points in the line of execution.
</p>
<p>
	 Interceptors can be used to decorate the normal execution. Also, by throwing FlowExceptions, interceptors can
	 alter the flow of execution. An interceptor can throw a FlowException if it wants Baritus to stop
	 normal processing and go to the given declared view (using ReturnNowFlowException) such as 'error', 
	 or dispatch to an arbitrary - non declared - URL (using DispatchNowFlowException) location.
