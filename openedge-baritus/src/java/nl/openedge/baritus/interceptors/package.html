	Interceptors.
</p>
<p>
	 Interceptors provide a means to encapsulate cross-cutting code that is 
	 executed on pre-defined points in the line of execution.
</p>
<p>
	 There are two kinds of interceptors. The first type are interceptors that
	 can be used to 'enrich' de model (formBeanContext), eg. load data, save session
	 attributes, etc. The second type of interceptors are interceptors that can
	 have an effect on the flow. These 'flow interceptors' can overrule the command
	 (perform method) and redirect to another view. The latter type can be used to
	 work with multi page forms coupled to one command or for instance implementing
	 a generic 'system error' type of view.
</p>
<p>
	 The first type of interceptors are allways called before the second type. 
	 Besides that, the interception points are exactely the same for both types.
