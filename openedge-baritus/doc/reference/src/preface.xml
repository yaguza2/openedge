		Baritus is an extension of the mature
	    web MVC framework Maverick. Maverick is a minimalist framework 
		which focuses solely on MVC (model 2) logic, allowing you to generate presentation using a variety 
		of templating and transformation technologies. Read more about Maverick 
		<ulink url="http://mav.sourceforge.net">here</ulink>.

		Baritus is an easy to use yet flexible framework that focuses on fine-grained bean 
		population and validation from HTTP request parameters. Furthermore, Baritus gives you
		an alternative to frameworks that focus on using XML configuration. Instead, Baritus
		gives ready-to-use defaults (like using introspection for conversion), 
		and lets you use Java to configure validation, population and ways to extend or 
		override the default behaviour.

		Baritus builds on Maverick, but does not alter it. Baritus provides a base class, 
		<literal>nl.openedge.baritus.FormBeanCtrl</literal> that is modeled after 
		<literal>org.infohazard.maverick.ctl.FormBeanUser</literal>
		from the Maverick project. Like <literal>FormBeanUser</literal>, instances of 
		<literal>FormBeanCtrl</literal> are singletons and use seperate JavaBeans for population.
