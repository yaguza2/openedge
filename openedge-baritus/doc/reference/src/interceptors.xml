        <title>Interception</title>

        <para>
            Interceptors provide a means to encapsulate cross-cutting code that is executed on 
			pre-defined points in the line of execution. Interceptors are classes that implement
			one or more interfaces from the packages 'nl.openedge.baritus.interceptors' and
			'nl.openedge.baritus.interceptors.flow'.
        </para>

		<para>
			There are two kinds of interceptors. The first type are interceptors that
			can be used to 'enrich' de model (formBeanContext), eg. load data, save session
			attributes, etc. The second type of interceptors are interceptors that can
			have an effect on the flow. These 'flow interceptors' can overrule the command
			(perform method) and redirect to another view. The latter type can be used to
			work with multi page forms coupled to one command or for instances implementing
			a generic 'system error' type of view.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			The first type of interceptors are allways called before the second type. 
			Besides that, the interception points are exactely the same for both types.

        <title>Normal interceptors</title>

        <para>
			This type of interceptors are used to add behaviour without having an influence on the
			flow of execution.
        </para>

        <title>Flow interceptors</title>

        <para>
