	    <para>
			The first pass in the population process is the conversion of request parameters etc. to
			Java objects and populating the provided form bean with those objects.
			If this is successful, you know that inputs for integers, dates, etc. conform to a
			valid form (e.g. 'foo' is not a valid integer, but '12' is).
	    </para>
		
		<para>
			Next, you might want to check if, for instance, a provided parameter not only is a
			valid integer, but is also greater than say 10. Or that a parameter not only is
			a valid date, but that this date also is after today.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			Validation can be performed on two levels: field and form level. Field level validation is related to 
			one input field (e.g. a request parameter) at a time. 
			Form level validation is executed regardles the provided parameters.
		</para>

		<para>
			Furthermore, whether a validation action is executed can be made dependend of a certain
			state (like the value a parameter) using 
			<literal>nl.openedge.baritus.validation.ValidationActivationRule</literal>s.
		</para>
