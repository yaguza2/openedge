1.0.9
-------------------------------------------------
- Refactored populateAndValidate from FormBeanContext to ExecutionParams.

1.0.8
-------------------------------------------------
- Interceptors and FlowInterceptors are now the same. From the docs:

	 Interceptors can be used to decorate the normal execution. Also, by throwing FlowExceptions, interceptors can
	 alter the flow of execution. An interceptor can throw a FlowException if it wants Baritus to stop
	 normal processing and go to the given declared view (using ReturnNowFlowException) such as 'error', 
	 or dispatch to an arbitrary - non declared - URL (using DispatchNowFlowException) location.

1.0.7
-------------------------------------------------
- Method signature FormBeanCtrlBase.getExecutionParams changes from:
	getExecutionParams() to getExecutionParams(ControllerContext cctx)
- The default implementation of getExecutionParams is to make a deep copy
	of the execution parameters of this control. This copy is saved as a request attribute -
	that is ignored by the population process - so that its' possibly changed parameters
	can be used by other (linked) controllers within the same request without having
	to change the parameters for all request (pre-1.0.7 just gave the reference to
	the instance variable of the singleton controller).
- If you want to override the default execution parameters for all requests (i.e. change
	the instance variable of the execution params, you can use the method 
	FormBeanCtrlBase.fixExecutionParams(ExecutionParams params). setExecutionParams is removed.

1.0.6
-------------------------------------------------
- Small fix concerning PerformException(Flow)Interceptors
- A lot of javadoc fixes
- Added property executeOtherNonFlowInterceptors to FlowInterceptorResult
	
1.0.5
-------------------------------------------------
- Added execution parameter trimStringInputValues (true by default)
	that indicates that populators should trim values of type String or String[]
	before populating/ converting.

1.0.4
-------------------------------------------------
- Fixes Maurice:
	- removed redundant Locale parameter in ValidationDelegate interface and in some
		of the private methods of FormBeanCtrlBase
	- removed redundant check on override field in DefaultValidatorDelegate
	- added exception handling and logging for form validators

1.0.3
-------------------------------------------------
- Typo 'stictPopulationMode' -> 'strictPopulationMode', class ExcecutionParams
- Fix in OgnlFieldPopulator: conversion was done twice in some cases

1.0.2
-------------------------------------------------
- Removed call back getErrorMessage in Validator interfaces
- Added parameter stickPopulationMode

1.0.1
-------------------------------------------------
- Registries are now public, incl. option to set default populator with PopulatorRegistry.
- Populators that were registered per field overrule regexpr registrated populators.

-------------------------------------------------
1.0 First public SF release.
