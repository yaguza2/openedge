    <section name="Using OpenEdge Modules">
      <p>
		To successfully use OpenEdge Modules, you should know about three things:
		<ul>
			<li>
				how to use types and (init)commands
			</li>
			<li>
				how to use Quartz (if you want to use the sceduler)
			</li>
			<li>
				how to configure Quartz and OpenEdge Modules in
				the environment you need.
			</li>
		</ul>
      </p>
      <subsection name="How to use types and (init)commands">
        <p>
			When you want to use OpenEdge Modules you don't have to do anything... by default.
			Classes that do not implement one of the registered interfaces will be handled as the
			default type. The types and the way they are handled are pluggable, but currently the
			following types are available:<br/>
		<ul>
			<li>
				ThrowAwayType<br/>
				When you ask the ModuleFactory for a component of type ThrowAwayType 
				you will get a new instance every time.
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li>
				SingletonType (default)<br/>
				A singleton component will be created once and only once 
				on the first query for it on the ModuleFactory. In other words: all ModuleFactory
				users share the same instance.
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li>
				ThreadSingletonType<br/>
				A thread singleton component will be created once and only once for each Thread
				on the first query for it in a Thread on the ModuleFactory. In other words: 
				The same instance will be shared in one Thread, but a different instance will
				be used for each seperate Thread.
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li>
				Job<br/>
				This is exactly the same as a Quartz job. The only differences from Quartz in using 
				the OpenEdge Modules framework are that:
				<ul>
					<li>
						when using OpenEdge Modules, you have a standard way of configuring Triggers
						on Jobs and passing parameters from configuration as JobDataMaps
					</li>
					<li>
						Jobs and Triggers will be sceduled automatically as defined in the OpenEdge
						Modules configuration
					</li>
				</ul>
				One important thing to remember when using Jobs is that you never get use Jobs
				directly from the ModuleFactory. As we wanted to stay as close as possible to 
				the default Quartz behaviour, we decided to let the Jobs keep their original
				interface and let them be managed completely by the Quartz sceduler. 
				The good news is that the Sceduler (of which the instance you can get
				from the ModuleFactory) has all the functionality you need when working 
				with Jobs and Triggers.
