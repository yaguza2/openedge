    <section name="Using Maven">
      <p>
		As we use Maven as our project build tool, you should have it
		installed when you want to build OpenEdge Modules from source.
		Learn more about Maven <a target="_new" href="http://maven.apache.org">here</a>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The downloaded install archive contains everything required to build
        OpenEdge Modules. The install archive has a single top-level
        directory named <code>//TODO</code> with all the 
        project related files beneath that. You can now unpack the install
        archive.
      </p>

      <p>
        The directory layout of OpenEdge Modules looks like this:
      </p>
        
      <source><![CDATA[
      .
      |-- src
      |     |-- java
      |     |-- test
      |     `-- etc
      |-- xdocs
      `-- target

      ]]></source>
      
      <p>
		The above layout conforms to the Maven standard directory layout, 
		where <code>src/java</code> has the main sources, 
		<code>src/test</code> has the unit tests and 
		<code>src/etc</code> has additional sources and documents.
	  </p>
      
      <p>
		When you have Maven installed properly, you can use the usual
		commands with this project. You probably want to use
		<code>maven jar</code> as this builds the jar you need when
		you want to use this project. The jar will be placed in 
		<code>\target</code>
	  </p>

	<section name="Preparing for Quartz">
      
	  <p>
		As OpenEdge Modules wraps as light as possible around Quartz,
		much of the preparation depends on how you want to use Quartz.
		It's best to check out 
		<a target="_new" href="http://www.part.net/quartz.html">Quartz itself</a>.
