Provides the main classes and interfaces for the Open Edge Module framework.

<p>
The module framework provides for an easy to use object factory that can build and
configure instances of objects (Modules) from a configuration xml document. Clients
can then ask the ModuleFactory for instances.
<p>
Furthermore, the module framework allowes consistent and easy use of the Quartz
framework for the handling of jobs (threaded modules).

<p>
Modules come in three main forms:<ul>
<li>Modules that implement nl.openedge.modules.ThrowAwayModule. A new instance will
be created for each request for a module.
<li>Modules that implement nl.openedge.modules.SingletonModule. Exactely one instance
will be created for each named module. This instance will be shared amongst all
requestees.
<li>Modules that implement org.quartz.Job. Job modules cannot be accessed directely
through the module factory. Jobs will be instantiated with JobDescriptions en can 
be coupled to Quartz triggers (see <a href="http://www.part.net/quartz_documentation.html">
Quartz documentation</a>). Jobs can be accessed through the quartz scheduler that is
provided by the module factory.
</ul>
<p>Modules can do their own configuration by implementing nl.openedge.modules.Configurable.
Configurable modules get the xml node of their module.
<p>Modules can have properties automatically set by implementing 
nl.openedge.modules.BeanModule. Properties will be tried to set according to
the given &lt;property&gt; child tags of the module in the configuration.
<p>If a module is both a bean and is configurable, it's (bean) properties will
be set prior to calling the Configurable.init(Element) method.
<p>A module that implements CriticalEventCaster can throw events that are routed
to CriticalEventListeners.

<p>
The main class for clients is the <code>ModuleFactory</code>. 
This factory is used to instantiate and initialise concrete implementations,
construct jobs, triggers and the map between those two and start the Quartz
scheduler with that information
