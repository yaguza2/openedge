Provides the main classes and interfaces for the Open Edge 
Access security framework.

<p>
The security framework gives you the option of using a near black box 
security implementation that is based on Java Authentication and Authorization 
Service (JAAS).<br> 
Authentication with JAAS is done by providing an implementation of the 
JAAS LoginModule. This framework not only gives you a default, ready to use 
implementations of LoginModule, but also provides a mechanism to add LoginModule 
implementations and policies to the JVM dynamically.<br>
For authorisation in web application environments, the <code>javax.servlet.Filter</code> 
implementation and <code>javax.security.auth.login.LoginContext</code> wrapper are 
given to provide a default way of doing authorization. 
<p>
The non-JAAS interface <code>UserManager</code> and it's (possible) implementations 
provide for default user/ role managent. This gives users an out of the box 
implementation of basic user- and role managent that, possibly combined with a 
application specific implementation of <code>LoginDecorator</code>, is 
probably sufficient for most cases of authorisation in applications. 

<p>
The main class for clients is the <code>AccessFactory</code>. 
This factory is used to instantiate and initialise concrete implementations 
of interfaces in this package based on the configuration document and holds a 
reference to relevant modules (i.e. the instance of <code>UserManager</code>
